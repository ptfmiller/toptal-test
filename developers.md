### Problem statement
Weâ€™d like to improve our explanation of what Toptal is on our developers homepage (https://www.toptal.com/developers). Please create a mockup of a new version of that page. Photoshop is not required, but we'd like to see a rough layout of the new page with the final copy and general imagery that you'd use. Please provide several options if you consider that appropriate.

## Summary 

See [the billboard project](billboard.md) for a discussion of our target audience.

The [mockup](developers.pdf) reflects a few changes to the site:

1. Added a testimonial section
  1. Title "What's it like to work with Toptal?"
  1. Picture of the person
  2. Name, company name
  3. Link to developer hired
  4. Paragraph story
    1. "I was nervous to hire externally, but this project was essential and was (so far) going nowhere. Toptal's risk-free trial period was what sold me. We had the design work for our website overhaul completed but couldn't get the various pieces to work together. Two days after I made the decision to get help through Toptal, (name) was up to speed on my problem and was already showing me some progress. After fours weeks of iterating and checking in over skype, (name) delivered a buttoned up website with code that my own developers can now handle. Now the website looks modern and our sales funnel is stronger than ever. 
2. Pulled in some sections from the homepage
  1. Replaced reviews single line with more detail
  2. Replaced extensive list of skills with shorter list from homepage
3. Rearranged several sections
  1. Moved list of well-known corporate clients to below reviews section
  2. Moved detailed examples of our developers up
  3. Moved toptal in the news to next-to-bottom
  4. 
4. Updated wording
  1. "Check out some of our developers" to "Our developers cover every skillset, with world-class experience."
  2. Changed toptal logo in top left to match homepage, should link to homepage
  3. Want to change blue links in "recent engineering articles" to black links to deemphasize. Leave the developers as blue though.
  4. Changed "call us" to "contact us", matching the homepage and allowing people to contact through email.

To see more of my thought process, read below.

## First review of the site

Nitpicks:
+ Comparison against homepage: there isn't a big difference between these two pages. I would think about what the difference is in terms of who our audience is. I'm going to assume that the homepage is for all prospective clients, whereas the developers page is for those clients interested mainly in developers.
+ Toptal logo has somewhat different styling than the homepage. Also, it links to the developers page, which is unexpected. Make it link to the homepage, and make it say "Toptal" rather than "developers"
+ Update 'call us' to link to the contact us page.
+ Unbold "Developers" in "Hire the top 3% of freelance developers."
+ The trustpilot rating is empty, making it look like it is an invitation to review rather than the link to actual reviews.
+ When you click on one of the developers, you go their page. So far so good. But when you click so hire this person, you get a generic page where you fill out some fields, and then submit with "show me talent". I wanted this specific person, but I'm now not confident I'm going to get them. We should make the experience one that diverges, with either "I want this person" or "I want this skillset". 
+ Hiring for a specific skill section it way too big. Either collapse it or have it link to a more detailed page. Even out of the context of this list, it's too long. I would find a way to filter it so someone can quickly cut that list from ~200 to 20.
+ "Check out some of our top developers". Do we have "non-top" developers? Maybe make a statement here, like "We have developers with every skillset, and extensive experience."
+ This page is so long. I would want to analyze our data to see how far people usually make it, and cut out whatever I can.
+ Make a click-through possible wherever the visitor is on the page.
+ The quote in the news from entrepreneur.com is not directed to clients
+ When you view this on mobile, the "toptal in the press" and "hiring for a specific skill" sections are taking up several screen-lengths and are really only mildly interesting information. I would move them to the bottom.
+ Recent engineering articles is cool information, but is going to push some people out of their focus on the hiring decision. I would keep it, but deemphasize the links to the actual articles by making them black. (still underlined or bolded)
+ I have a hover-ad show up when I first visited this page and moved my mouse to the url-space on my browser, kind of a rip-cord "don't leave!" thing. I'd look at whether that has ever moved any conversion and consider getting rid of it.
+ The logos of brand-name companies who trust us is on the webpage twice.
 
Summary thoughts:
+ This page is long, but long may not be bad. There are a lot of modules here, and I would want to put the most "converty" ones up top. Analysis is appropriate here but I'm going to guess at what converts, which is going to favor things with images of people, ability to click-through, and pieces that speak directly to the prospect's need.
+ I'm not going to be suggesting big changes to this page. We're going to want to keep the style as-is because this is part of the larger page. Much of the content here is good already.
+ What's missing? 
  + Reviews--whenever I shop around I want to hear other customers' feedback. Include a link to all reviews that does something like the Amazon's "most helpful positive and most helpful critical review" thing. 
  + Link to a testimonial. Give a paragraph intro. The testimonial could give details that clients will wonder about, like exactly how long did it take to get set up, what was the ramp-up time, what medium did they use to communicate, how long did the project take, how did it compare to other solutions they have tried.
