# Billboard

### Problem statment
We are planning to invest $100k in a billboard ad to promote Toptal in San Francisco. We need your advice:
* Where would you put the billboard? Why?
* What would you put on the billboard? Make a mockup of the billboard, include the copy that you would put there.
* How would you decide whether the billboard was successful? What would you measure?
* How would you track results?

# Developers page

### Problem statement
Weâ€™d like to improve our explanation of what Toptal is on our developers homepage (https://www.toptal.com/developers). Please create a mockup of a new version of that page. Photoshop is not required, but we'd like to see a rough layout of the new page with the final copy and general imagery that you'd use. Please provide several options if you consider that appropriate.
