### Problem statement

We are planning to invest $100k in a billboard ad to promote Toptal in San Francisco. We need your advice:
Where would you put the billboard? Why?
What would you put on the billboard? Make a mockup of the billboard, include the copy that you would put there.
How would you decide whether the billboard was successful? What would you measure?
How would you track results?
